Generic Selenium WebDriver Windows Install Speedrun checklist
=============================================================

[ ] Check what you need to install by typing console commands
    [ ] "javac -version"
          - if it fails install java jdk
    [ ] "mvn -version"
          - if it fails install maven

[ ] Install Current version of Firefox

[ ] Download Java
    [ ] search for "download java sdk" (do not install the normal JRE from java.com)
    [ ] or on a Mac, you're prompted to do this when you check "javac -version"

[ ] Install Java JDK
    [ ] Windows
        - e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_10
        [ ] add the Java "\bin" folder to the path if it hasn't been added 
           e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_10\bin
        [ ] create a JAVA_HOME environment variable while there for the root path 
            e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_10
            - some people add a JDK_HOME for the root path as well (I haven't done this)
    [ ] Mac
        [ ] download
        [ ] export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home)"
        [ ] add JAVA_HOME to ~/.bash_profile


[ ] Install Maven
    [ ] Download Maven http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation
    [ ] Windows
        [ ] Unzip maven to a directory (avoid one with spaces in it)
            - e.g. C:\mvn\apache-maven-3.0.4
        [ ] create maven environment variables
        [ ] create an M2_HOME in System Variables
            - C:\mvn\apache-maven-3.0.4
        [ ] add %M2_HOME%\bin to the path in System Variables
    [ ] Mac
        [ ] Unzip to /usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.0.4
            - if /usr/local does not exist then "sudo mkdir /usr/local"
        [ ] export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.2.3
        [ ] export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
        [ ] export PATH=$M2:$PATH
    [ ] check "mvn -version"
        [ ] on Mac, add the above exports to ~/.bash_profile

[ ] everything is installed, check the environment variables by displaying them on the console
    [ ] Windows
        [ ] echo %M2_HOME%
        [ ] echo %JAVA_HOME%
    [ ] Mac
        [ ] echo $M2_HOME
        [ ] echo $JAVA_HOME

[ ] Download Test Project (this has a simple pom.xml and a basic test to run)
    [ ] visit https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingSeleniumWebDriver
    [ ] download the zip file and unzip somewhere

[ ] check most up to date version of webdriver in the unzipped pom.xml file
    [ ] check the webdriver downloads page or the maven page for the up to date version
    [ ] amend the pom.xml file if the version number is not up to date

[ ] run my first test from the command line
    [ ] use the command line to "cd" to the directory you unarchived the source code to
    [ ] mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstTest

[ ] Install and run IntelliJ Community Edition

[ ] open project for the unzipped pom.xml file

[ ] run MyFirstTest class
    [ ] right click on the class in the project window and select "Run 
    [ ] you may need to tell intellij where the SDK is, 
        - use the project settings to create an new SDK config
          using the JAVA_HOME path above

[ ] When the test runs from the IDE, you are finished your install and setup

Generic Links:
==============

+ Download Java SDK From
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
  - 1.8 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
  - 1.7 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

+ Download Maven From
http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

+ sample test project from
https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingSeleniumWebDriver

+ Check current webdriver version from
http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/
or
http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/maven.jsp

+ Download IntelliJ from
http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

Installation on XP Notes:
=========================

- I installed using the Windows XP VM from modern.ie, 
  with Java 1.7, maven 3.2.3, Webdriver 2.43.1, IntelliJ 13.1.5

- need to use JDK 1.7, JDK 1.8 reports a warning on Windows XP

- download a different text editor to edit the pom.xml (I used notepad++)
     - You may need to download a better editor than notepad.exe I use notepad++
     -  download notepad ++ from 
     http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download

- You need to 'unblock' Java and the IDE etc. 
  for the Windows Firewall as you run through the checklist. 
  Do this, otherwise they won't be able to work

- Edit SDK by right clicking and choosing "Open Module Settings", 
  then edit the SDK for the Project and press [OK]
  - choose the location of the Java JDK you installed 
    (sometimes you don't have to do this)

+ After test passes in the IDE - ignore the Info Message from WebDriver

"Oct 07, 2014 10:40:36 AM org.openqa.selenium.os.UnixProcess$SeleniumWatchDog destroyHarder
INFO: Command failed to close cleanly. Destroying forcefully (v2). 
org.openqa.selenium.os.UnixProcess$SeleniumWatchDog@da44a7

Process finished with exit code 0
"
It worked fine


Installation on Mac Notes:
==========================

- I installed using a VM with OS X Mavericks, then Java 1.8,
  maven 3.2.3, Webdriver 2.43.1, IntelliJ 13.1.5

- slightly different order of the install than Windows because:
  I was prompted to install JDK when I typed "javac -version" so
  I followed the instructions at that point.

  I didn't need to install Firefox early because I could use the
  build in Safari browser to download software.

  I didn't need to install a separate text editor as the build in
  handled the pom.xml file fine.

- with Maven
  - on mac, downloaded the zip
  - I didn't have a /usr/local so I had to "sudo mkdir /usr/local"
  - then I extracted the contents into an apache-maven-3.2.3 directory 
    in /usr/local (I probably should have created an /apache-maven 
    directory as well, but I didn't
    
    then I created all the exports in the terminal

    export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.2.3
    export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
    export PATH=$M2:$PATH

    when I tried mvn -version it recognised maven but JAVA_HOME 
    wasn't setup so I had to 

    export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home)"

    Then it worked

    Then open a new tab and vi ~/.bash_profile and copy and paste 
    in all the exports

    then create a new tab and "mvn --version" to check that it worked

- Firefox
  searched for "firefox" then download from the mozilla.org site
  ran it
  nice overlapping dialogs that I had to deal with

- when I ran "mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstTest", my wifi connection dropped 
  in the middle, but I restarted wifi and ran the mvn command again 
  and it completed fine - one reason to use Maven
